## CIS3110 - Lecture Notes and summaries

The folders below contain:
  - full course lecture transcriptions, in both .md and .pdf format
  - Summarized Notes (AI generated) of the full transcriptions in both .md and .pdf format
  - The note summaries refer to textbook references as per the pdf in this directory (CIS3110-W25-Topic-and-chapters.pdf) - this is compeletly AI generated, so it may be fairly accurate, somehwat accurate or complete hogwash... it hasn't been verified - I am blindly leaving it to AI to determine what part of the lecture align with the PDF textbook refences. 

I claim no ownershipt of this content - it is just a text version of the audi files for the purpose of studying.
