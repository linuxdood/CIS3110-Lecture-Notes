## CIS3110 - Lecture Notes and summaries
University of Guelph
The folders below contain:
  - full course lecture transcriptions, in both .md and .pdf format
  - Summarized Notes (AI generated) of the full transcriptions in both .md and .pdf format

I claim no ownershipt of this content - it is just a text version of the audi files for the purpose of studying.
