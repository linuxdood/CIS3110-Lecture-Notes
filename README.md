## CIS3110 - Lecture Notes and summaries

The folders below contain:
  - full course lecture transcriptions, in both .md and .pdf format
  - Summarized Notes (AI generated) of the full transcriptions in both .md and .pdf format
  - The note summaries refer to textbook references as per the pdf in this directory (CIS3110-W25-Topic-and-chapters.pdf) - this is completely AI generated, so it may be fairly accurate, somewhat accurate or complete hogwash... it hasn't been verified - I am blindly leaving it to AI to determine what part of the lecture align with the PDF textbook refences... So trust at your own peril. 

I claim no ownership of this content - it is just a text version of the audio files from the lecture for the purpose of studying and preparing for finals.
